* Assignment 3: Animation
** Plan
- [X] create bat model (Body and two wings)
- [X] flapping wings animation
- [X] line-drawing animation points
- [X] bezier curve animation path
- [X] bat move along path
- [X] scaling while moving
- [ ] move line points with mouse
- [ ] UI for editing / playing

Possible extensions:
- Bezier curve bat model
- Save animation as MOV/AVI
- Good code comments
- Motion blur of moving objects
- Efficient Bezier evaluation (recursive deCastlejau split rule)

Line/curve drawing:
- add point model, draw list of points
- use drawlines to draw lines between points
- make bezier curve using 4 points
- get x amount of points on
