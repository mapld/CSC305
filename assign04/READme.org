* Assignment 4
** Plan

Ez things:
- IMGUI to control a few things (noise parameters + height adjustments, reroll , terrain texture params) (5%)
- Bezier curve (5%)
- height-based FPS camera (5%)

Maybe doable:
- Wave animation (10%)
- GPU noise (5%)
- Infinite terrain(ez if gpu noise) (15%)
- Spherical world (need to think about noise on edges first) (10%)

Hard:
- Framebuffer reflection
